# Nicegist - writing for hackers

When I recognized that [gist.io](https://github.com/idan/gistio) is dead, I stumbled upon [a comment](https://github.com/idan/gistio/issues/74#issuecomment-408671352) in gist.io's issue tracker, that suggested to build a pure JavaScript implementation to be hosted on GitHub pages.

I liked the idea. 45 minutes later, this first working draft was born.
